# Message Format

ZWaves messages are single ZWave packets, and can be either requests or responses, depending on the **Request Type** field of the ZWave packet. The type of message is specified by the **Message Type** field of the ZWave packet.

For better documentation readibility, the message types are grouped as followed:

* [Controller](controller.md)
* [Discovery](discovery.md)
